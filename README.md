# USBCheck
An Android App to detect whether your USB-C to USB-A cables are safe and compliant.

USBCheck will check if the USB-C to USB-A cable you are using is compliant to the USB-C specification and safe to use by detecting how much power the cable is drawing from the source. 

The device must be plugged into a computer and not an AC power outlet whilst testing.
